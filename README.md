# Face-Detection
Face detection is a computer technology being used in a variety of applications that identifies human faces in digital images. Face detection also refers to the psychological process by which humans locate and attend to faces in a visual scene.

## Technology & Framework
- python 3.9
- OpenCV
## OpenCV
Face detection using Haar cascades is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained with a set of input data. OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc.

## Configuration
- Ensure you can run Python from the command line
  - Before you go any further, make sure you have Python and that the expected version is available from your command line. You can check this by running:
```
py --version
```
You should get some output like Python 3.9.7. If you do not have Python, please install the latest 3.x version from python.org 

- Installing Pip
```
py -m pip --version
```

- Installing OpenCV

```
pip install opencv-python
```
## Project Structure
- work with images
```
Python faces.py
```
- work with video
- work with realtime
