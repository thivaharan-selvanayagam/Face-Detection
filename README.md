# Face-Detection
Face detection is a computer technology being used in a variety of applications that identifies human faces in digital images. Face detection also refers to the psychological process by which humans locate and attend to faces in a visual scene.

## Technology & Framework
- python 3.9
- OpenCV
## OpenCV
Face detection using Haar cascades is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained with a set of input data. OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc.

## Configuration
### Ensure you can run Python from the command line
Before you go any further, make sure you have Python and that the expected version is available from your command line. You can check this by running:
```
py --version
```
You should get some output like Python 3.9.7. If you do not have Python, please install the latest 3.x version from python.org 

- Installing Pip
```
py -m pip --version
```

- Installing OpenCV

```
pip install opencv-python
```
## Project Structure
- work with images
```
